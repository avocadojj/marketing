**Tutorial: Using dbt Cloud with BigQuery to Create a Data Warehouse and Datamart**

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up a data warehouse and a datamart using dbt Cloud and Google BigQuery. dbt Cloud is a powerful data transformation and modeling platform, and BigQuery is a fully-managed serverless data warehouse by Google. We'll go through the steps of creating the necessary infrastructure, setting up dbt Cloud, building models, and creating a datamart for reporting and analytics.

**Prerequisites:**
- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with billing enabled.
- Google Cloud SDK installed and configured on your local machine.
- Access to dbt Cloud (sign up at https://www.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/).

**Step 1: Set Up BigQuery Project**
1. Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console: Go to the GCP Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/), click on the project dropdown, and select "New Project."

2. Enable the BigQuery API: In the project dashboard, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard," search for "BigQuery API," and enable it.

**Step 2: Create a BigQuery Dataset**
1. In the GCP Console, go to "BigQuery."

2. Click on your project name and select "Create Dataset."

3. Give your dataset a name and choose the default location (e.g., US).

**Step 3: Configure dbt Cloud Project**
1. Sign in to dbt Cloud (https://cloud.getdbt.com/).

2. Click on "Create New Project."

3. Choose the repository hosting service where you have your dbt project (e.g., GitHub).

4. Connect your repository to dbt Cloud by following the on-screen instructions.

**Step 4: Create dbt Models**
1. In your dbt project, create the necessary models using SQL and dbt's Jinja templating syntax. Models define the logic for transforming and organizing your data.

2. Make sure your dbt project includes the necessary BigQuery configuration in the `dbt_project.yml` file:

**Step 5: Compile and Run dbt Models in dbt Cloud**
1. In dbt Cloud, navigate to your project and click on the "Compile" button. This will check for any syntax errors in your dbt models.

2. Once compiled successfully, click on the "Run" button to execute the dbt models. dbt Cloud will connect to your BigQuery project, create the necessary views, and populate the data.

**Step 6: Create a Datamart**
1. In your dbt project, create additional models that aggregate and organize the data for reporting and analytics. These models will form the foundation of your datamart.

2. Use the `ref` function to refer to the models you created in previous steps. This way, dbt will create the dependencies automatically.

3. Apply transformations and aggregations as needed to shape the data into the desired format for your datamart.

**Step 7: Run Datamart Models in dbt Cloud**
1. Similar to Step 5, compile and run the datamart models in dbt Cloud.
