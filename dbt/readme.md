#Using dbt in this Repository with DAG
In this project, we utilize dbt as part of our data processing workflow. Within our Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), there are two main tasks: `dbt_init_task` and `run_dbt_task`. These tasks are further composed of several dbt commands:

##DBT Commands:
`dbt deps`: This command fetches and updates the dependencies that the dbt project relies on.

`dbt seed`: This command loads seed files into the database. Seed files are CSV or YAML files that define some of the static data in your project.

`dbt run`: This command compiles the dbt project and runs the necessary SQL queries to create defined models in the database.

`dbt test`: This command validates the data within your models to ensure that it adheres to the defined tests.



##Structure of the Workflow:
`dbt_init_task`: This task initializes the dbt environment.

`run_dbt_task`: This task consists of several dbt commands that execute in sequence, including dbt deps, dbt seeds, dbt run, and dbt test.


##Reasoning in Staging, Data Warehouse, and Data Mart:
* Staging: Staging is the phase where raw data is first loaded into the system. By using dbt for transforming data in staging, we can apply initial cleaning and structure to the raw data. In files `stg__marketing.sql`, this part of the code prepares the raw marketing data. It removes any duplicates and selects the required columns, creating a clean view of the marketing data for further processing. With help `dbt deps`, in this step also encode categorical variable to become numerical so make DS job more easy.

* Data Warehouse: In the data warehouse phase, dbt allows us to transform, aggregate, and enrich data to be used for various analytical purposes. This creates a single repository of organized data collected from various sources.

1. Economic Context Dimension (dim__ECONOMICCONTEXT)
This view defines the economic context dimension by selecting unique combinations of economic indicators. It helps in analyzing how different economic factors influence the marketing efforts.

2. Contact Dimension (dim__CONTACT)
This view captures distinct contacts and their attributes such as the type of contact, month, day of the week, and duration. It allows for the analysis of the marketing campaigns' contact strategies.

3. Client Dimension (dim__CLIENT)
This view captures unique client characteristics, such as age, job, marital status, education, credit, housing, and loans. This information helps in customer segmentation and targeting in marketing campaigns.

4. Campaign Dimension (dim__CAMPAIGN)
This view captures unique characteristics related to marketing campaigns, including the number of contacts, days since last contact, previous contacts, and outcomes. It can be used to analyze the effectiveness of different campaigns.

5. Fact Tables (fact__tables)
The fact tables merge the different dimensions together, creating a comprehensive view that can be used for various analytical purposes. It represents the relationship between clients, contacts, campaigns, and economic context.

* Data Mart: Data marts are subsets of data warehouses and are used for specific business lines or departments. By using dbt, we can further refine data, creating specialized views for different parts of the business.

1. Economic Impact Table
This table aggregates data to analyze the economic impact on subscriptions, including summarizing subscriptions, non-subscriptions, and deriving ratios like Price Index to Euribor Rate.

2. Contact Summary Table
This table summarizes the contact information and calculates the total number of subscriptions per contact type. It aids in understanding the effectiveness of different contact methods.

3. Client Summary Table
This table provides a summary of client information, including total contacts and subscriptions. It can be used for analyzing customer behavior and preferences.

4. Campaign Summary Table
This table provides a summary of campaign data, including the number of contacts for the current campaign, days since last contact, previous campaign contacts, and outcomes. It allows for a deeper analysis of campaign strategies and results.

##Overall Structure and Reasoning
The entire code structure follows a typical data warehousing approach, where data is extracted, loaded, and transformed (ETL) into various dimensions and facts. By structuring the data this way, the organization can efficiently analyze different aspects of its marketing efforts, client behavior, and the influence of economic factors.

This design supports advanced analytics and reporting, helping the organization make informed decisions. By using dbt's materialized views, the processing is optimized, allowing for efficient updates when underlying data changes.

This design will contribute to strategic planning, performance monitoring, and continuous improvement in marketing strategies and execution. It also allows for integration with other business areas for a more comprehensive understanding of the overall business environment.
